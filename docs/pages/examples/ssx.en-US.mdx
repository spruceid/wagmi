# Sign-In with Ethereum and SSX

[Sign-In with Ethereum](https://login.xyz) is an authentication standard ([EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361)) that enables secure communication between a frontend and backend. SIWE is a powerful method for creating user sessions based on a wallet connection, and much more!

Setting up, configuring, and establishing session with SIWE can be done easily with SSX.

The example below builds on the [Connect Wallet](/examples/connect-wallet) and [Sign Message](/examples/sign-message) examples. Try it out before moving on.
